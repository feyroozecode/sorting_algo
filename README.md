# Sorting Algorithms in Java

This project contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in Java, including Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through getting a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Java installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [Oracle's Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

To get started with this project, first clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mamane19/sorting_algo.git
```
  2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

After cloning, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sorting_algo
```

## Running the Programs

The project includes implementations of two sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. Here's how you can compile and run each program:

### Bubble Sort

To compile and run `BubbleSort.java`, use the following commands:

```bash
javac BubbleSort.java && java BubbleSort
```

### Selection Sort

To compile and run `SelectionSort.java`, use the following commands:

```bash
javac SelectionSort.java && java SelectionSort
```
